# Name-Comparing 

Name-Compare is a project that decides how much unique names entered in the arguments by the following parameters:
  * one or more of them has a typo
  * one or more of them is nickname of each other
  
  ** it's also handling middle names
  
## Usage

```java
import main.uniqueNamesCounter;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      
       int howMuchUnique= uniqueNamesCounter.countUniqueNames(firstFirstName ,firstLastName ,secondFirstName ,secondLastName , Full_name);
    
    }
}



```
